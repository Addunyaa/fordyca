# FORDYCA (FOraging Robots use DYnamic CAches)

This is mainly just a collection of things I don't want to forget at the moment.

## Labelling Issues

- Critical is for things that are main features/super important, or are
  segmentation-fault level bugs.

- Major is for stuff that is supports main project features.

- Normal is for things that I will need eventually, but could be done now or at
  some point in the near-ish future.

- Minor is for things that would be nice to have (think enhancements), but that
  I can live with without too much headache at the moment.

- Feature is for pretty much everything that isn't "create an experimental
  scenario".

- Enhancements are pretty self-explanatory.
